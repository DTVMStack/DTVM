# Type System

## Overview

The type system in the compiler is designed to provide a robust and efficient way to handle types throughout the compilation process. It is inspired by LLVM's type system while maintaining its own unique characteristics optimized for WebAssembly and blockchain environments.

## Type Hierarchy

```
Type
├── Primitive Types
│   ├── Integer Types
│   │   ├── i32
│   │   └── i64
│   └── Floating-Point Types
│       ├── f32
│       └── f64
├── FunctionType
└── PointerType
```

## Type Categories

### 1. Primitive Types

#### Integer Types
- **i32**: 32-bit signed integer
- **i64**: 64-bit signed integer

#### Floating-Point Types
- **f32**: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point
- **f64**: 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point

### 2. FunctionType

Function types represent function signatures with the following characteristics:
- Return type
- Parameter types
- Memory layout: `[FunctionType own members, return Type*, parameter Type*...]`

#### Key Features
- **Uniqueness**: Only one instance of a FunctionType with the same signature exists
- **Context Management**: Managed within the Context to avoid duplication
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses ArrayRef for parameter lists to avoid temporary objects
- **Single Return Value**: Currently supports single return value

### 3. PointerType

Pointer types represent memory addresses and are used for:
- Memory access operations
- Function pointers
- Global variable references

## Type Uniqueness

The type system ensures type uniqueness through:
- **DenseSet**: Used for storing unique type instances
- **KeyInfo**: Used for type lookup without creating temporary objects
- **FunctionTypeKeyInfo**: Special handling for function type uniqueness

## Memory Management

### FunctionType Memory Layout
```
[FunctionType own members, return Type*, parameter Type*...]
```

### Optimization Considerations
- **Parameter Lists**: Use ArrayRef to avoid creating temporary objects
- **Type Deduplication**: Avoid duplicate type instances through Context management
- **Memory Allocation**: Use BumpPtrAllocator for efficient memory management

## Key Design Points

1. **Type Safety**
   - Types are immutable once created
   - Type operations are thread-safe
   - Type information is preserved throughout compilation

2. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Use of memory pools for allocation
   - Avoidance of temporary objects
   - Efficient type deduplication

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Fast type comparison
   - Efficient type lookup
   - Minimal memory overhead

## Notes

- Types should be treated as immutable
- Type operations should be thread-safe
- Memory management should be handled by the Context
- Type information should be preserved throughout compilation

## Best Practices

1. **Type Creation**
   - Always use Context for type creation
   - Check for existing types before creation
   - Use appropriate memory allocators

2. **Type Usage**
   - Prefer type queries over type casting
   - Use type-safe operations
   - Handle type errors gracefully

3. **Memory Management**
   - Use provided memory pools
   - Avoid manual memory management
   - Follow RAII principles

## Future Extensions

Planned enhancements to the type system include:
- Support for vector types (SIMD)
- Support for reference types
- Enhanced type inference
- Multi-value return types
- Extended type safety features

## Notes

- Types should be treated as immutable
- Type operations should be thread-safe
- Memory management should be handled by the Context
- Type information should be preserved throughout compilation
